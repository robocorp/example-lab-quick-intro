# The script is composed from 3 different cells you can see below.
#
# ðŸ‘‰ **Click on each cell, and then the `â–¸`, one after the other:**
# - The `â–¸` button is found in the icon toolbar
# - Clicking the cell and then the `â–¸` button readies the cell for process execution by *compiling* the cell
# - After the `*** Keyword ***` cell has been compiled it can be run by clicking the `Find Image` button that appears
# - Running `*** Tasks ***` actually runs the whole robot
# - Make sure all cells have been run by checking the `[ ]` indicator. If run, there's a number inside.

# Additional ways to run the robot:
#
# ðŸ‘‰ **Running all the cells in an open `.robot` file in one go by clicking `â–¸â–¸`:**
#    - The `â–¸â–¸` button is found in the icon toolbar
#    - This is known as '*running the notebook*' and will compile and execute all the cells in one go (without needing to click the `Find Image` button that appears)
#    - This run method will ask whether you want to '*Restart Kernel?*'... That's okay! You can click `Restart`
#
#
# ðŸ‘‰ **Running the main task configured for a robot by clicking `â–¸ Run Robot`:**
#    - The `â–¸ Run Robot` button is found at the top-right of the Lab
#    - The robot is run from a clean state in new virtual environment. Use this to verify everything is ready for production.
#    - The default *Task* for a project is configured in the [robot.yaml](./robot.yaml) file.
#    - In the [robot.yaml](./robot.yaml) file you have more control over your robot and can define multiple tasks.
#    - Robot's dependencies are defined in [conda.yaml](./conda.yaml) and applied automatically.
